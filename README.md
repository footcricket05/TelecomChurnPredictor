# Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression

This project aims to address the issue of customer churn in the telecom industry by leveraging predictive analytics techniques. Customer churn is a significant concern for telecommunication providers, with a potential loss of millions of dollars each month. By focusing on quality service, lower cost subscription plans, and positive customer experiences, providers can increase customer retention.

This project uses logistic regression to predict customer churn based on different layers of data, including billing history, subscription plans, cost of content, network/bandwidth utilization, and more. The goal is to obtain a 360-degree view of the customer and identify patterns and trends that influence customer satisfaction.
